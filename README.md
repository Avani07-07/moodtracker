📝 Project Description
The Fan Speed Mood Detector is a fun and interactive web application that detects a user’s typing speed in real time and recommends a matching fan speed along with a mood. The faster the user types, the higher the fan speed — from sleepy to angry mode.

😵‍💫 The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Absolutely nothing. People are typing just fine... but what if their keyboard strokes controlled a fan of emotions?

🪄 The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This entirely unnecessary web app listens to your typing speed and responds with a virtual fan that changes speed and shows your "mood" — from sleepy to angry. It’s useless... but fun!

💻 Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used
For Software
Languages Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Tools: VS Code

Features/Logic:

JavaScript event listeners (input, setInterval)

Typing speed calculation (keystrokes per second)

Dynamic DOM manipulation (fan emojis, speed labels)

Real-time mood detection via keystroke analysis

For Hardware
None – browser-based software only

🚀 Implementation
Installation
No installation required – just open the HTML file in a browser.

This project captures the user's typing speed in real time, compares it to defined levels (slow, medium, fast), and dynamically displays a mood and fan speed. Faster typing triggers more intense moods. Vanilla JavaScript handles keyboard event tracking, speed calculation, and DOM updates.

Project Description

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People type without knowing how their mood could control an imaginary fan. That’s just sad.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A completely unnecessary but wildly entertaining web app that links your typing speed to a fan's mood — sleepy, chill, tensed, or full-blown angry. Because... why not?

Tensed Mode – Fan Speed 4: Fast typing triggers a “tensed” status, just before full rage.

Workflow: This project tracks keystrokes in real time, calculates speed, and matches it with a pre-defined fan speed and mood. It updates the UI dynamically using JavaScript.
